Unfortunatly this project also needs crypto but this uses another approach to login which might work better, using Linking and WebBrowser from expo

requires events, http2, stream, asyncstorage-down

I hit issue react-native-randombytes issue 13 before
realising that react-native-crypto issue 45: to sum it up, we can't use expo
