Needs crypto and http2

Stuck when trying to load zlib: _stream_transform doesn't get picked up for some reason even if it is installed.

This work though.

Using redirectHandler with a method that opens the browser window and then a redirectUrl that goes back to the app, it's what I tried to do with a WebView, but It was impossible for me to get it to compile.
